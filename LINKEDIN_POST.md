🚀 Just Launched: BDIX Connectivity Tester - A Next.js Web App for Bangladesh 🇧🇩

I'm excited to share my latest project: BDIX Connectivity Tester (https://test-bdix.vercel.app/), a comprehensive web application built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS.

🔧 Key Features:
• Real-time connectivity testing for BDIX servers (local content servers in Bangladesh)
• Categorized server testing (FTP, Media, Software, ISP-specific)
• Dark/light mode, responsive design, PWA support
• Analytics dashboard with test history and performance metrics
• Speed testing capabilities
• Favorites system and server comparison tools

🎯 Problem Solved:
In Bangladesh, internet users often struggle to determine which local content servers are accessible through BDIX (Bangladesh Internet Exchange). This tool helps users quickly identify which servers they can access directly without international bandwidth, resulting in faster speeds and better performance.

🛠️ Technical Highlights:
• Modern React patterns with hooks and context
• Framer Motion for smooth animations
• Local storage for persistent user preferences
• Concurrent server testing with abort functionality
• Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
• Performance optimized with React.memo and useCallback
